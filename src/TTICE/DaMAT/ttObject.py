This is a python class for tensors in TT-format.
Through this object you can compute TT-decomposition of multidimensional arrays in
one shot using [TTSVD algorithm](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/epdf/10.1137/090752286)
or incrementally using [TT-ICE algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12487).

Furthermore, this object allows exporting and importing TT-cores using native
format (`.ttc`) and intermediary formats (`.txt`).

class ttObject:
    """
    Python object for tensors in Tensor-Train format.

    This object computes the TT-decomposition of multidimensional arrays using
    `TTSVD`_, `TT-ICE`_, and `TT-ICE*`_.
    It furthermore contains an inferior method, ITTD, for benchmarking purposes.

    This object handles various operations in TT-format such as dot product and norm.
    Also provides supporting operations for uncompressed multidimensional arrays such
    as reshaping and transpose.
    Once the tensor train approximation for a multidimensional array is computed, you
    can compute projection of appropriate arrays onto the TT-cores, reconstruct
    projected or compressed tensors and compute projection/compression accuracy.

    You can also save/load tensors as `.ttc` or `.txt` files.
    Attributes
    ----------
    inputType: type
        Type of the input data. This determines how the object is initialized.
    originalData:
        Original multidimensional input array. Generally will not be stored
        after computing
        an initial set of TT-cores.
    method: :obj:`str`
        Method of computing the initial set of TT-cores. Currently only accepts
        `'ttsvd'` as input
    ttEpsilon: :obj:`float`
        Desired relative error upper bound.
    ttCores: :obj:`list` of :obj:`numpy.array`
        Cores of the TT-decomposition. Stored as a list of numpy arrays.
    ttRanks: :obj:`list` of :obj:`int`
        TT-ranks of the decomposition. Stored as a list of integers.
    nCores: :obj:`int`
        Number of TT-cores in the decomposition.
    nElements: :obj:`int`
        Number of entries present in the current `ttObject`.
    originalShape: :obj:`tuple` or :obj:`list`
        Original shape of the multidimensional array.
    reshapedShape: :obj:`tuple` or :obj:`list`
        Shape of the multidimensional array after reshaping. Note that
        this attribute is only meaningful before computing a TT-decomposition
    indexOrder: :obj:`list` of :obj:`int`
        Keeps track of original indices in case of transposing the input array.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data: :obj:`numpy.array` or :obj:`list`

            `numpy array` or `list of numpy arrays`.
            If list of numpy arrays are presented as input, the object will interpret it
            as the TT-cores of an existing decomposition.
        epsilon: :obj:`float`, optional
            The relative error upper bound desired for approximation. Optional for cases
            when `data` has type `list`.
        keepData: :obj:`bool`, optional
            Optional boolean variable to determine if the original array will be kept
            after compression. Set to `False` by default.
        samplesAlongLastDimension: :obj:`bool`, optional
            Boolean variable to ensure if the samples are stacked along the last
            dimension. Assumed to be `True` since it is one of the assumptions in
            TT-ICE.
        method: :obj:`str`, optional
            Determines the computation method for tensor train decomposition of
            the multidimensional array presented as `data`. Set to `'ttsvd'` by default.

            Currently the package only has support for ttsvd, additional support such as
