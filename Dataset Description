Hurricane dataset
20-year-long records from 1996 to 2015 of Community Atmospheric Model v5 (CAM5) dataset. This dataset contains snapshots of global atmospheric states for every three hours 
(time step = 3hours) 
Each snapshot contains 6 climate variables:  such as PSL (Sea level pressure), U850 (Zonal wind), V850 (Meridional wind), PRECT (Precipitation), TS (Surface temperature), QREFHT (Reference high humidity)
A fixed length of 10 hours is used. The input image size is 128 x 257 pixels.
