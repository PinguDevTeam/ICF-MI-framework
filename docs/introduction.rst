Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**ICF-MI** combines two statistical algorithms, **TT-ICE** which is a tensor-train decomposition alogorithm and **GIM** which is a model identification alogorithm.
The Algorithm has the following salient features:

* **TT-ICE** is a tensor-train decomposition algorithm which is a generalization of the popular **ICE** algorithm. It is a non-parametric algorithm which can be used to decompose a high-dimensional function into a sum of low-dimensional functions.

* **GIM** is an information-theoretic model identification algorithm which can be used to identify the model which best fits the data.

* **ICF-MI** is a combination of **TT-ICE** and **GIM** and can therefore be used to identify the model parameter in a cost efficient manner.
