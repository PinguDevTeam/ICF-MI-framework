Initialy this project was going to use data from the hydrocode created at LANL known as XRAGE. 
This data was generated but a release from LANL was not issued in time. The efforts of the data curration are described below. 

Roughly 1000+ XRAGE simulations would be used in this project with the goal of identifying which initial conditions had the most impact on the result (evolution of the 
interface over some time step). 

Each simulation was set up to run for 30ns. An initial 10 mode perturbation was perscribed to an interface between two fluids of different densities. 
This perturbation would seed the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability to grow as a shock moved through the interface. 
For each simulation intatial phase and amplitude would be altered for each mode giving roughly 20 intial conditions that would be altered. 
The amplitude across the 10 modes would have an overall average of 1 um and phase would be set between 0 and 2pi. 

Each simulation produces 300 snapshots for each variable we desire to examine. We look at the material and density files (600 "snapshots" per simulation) 
Each of these snapshots is convereted into an HDF file and then from there converted into a .FITS file. The contour of the interface is extraced, mix width is messured and 
the contour is plotted as it evolves in time.
